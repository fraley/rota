# Finding Vallco (Cupertino Ice Center)
Please google for [Cupertino Ice Center](https://www.google.com/search?&q=cupertino+ice+center)
and get the address and directions _**before**_ you try to head over to the rink.
The door will be shut, but unlocked.
Rink management wants the door shut (especially in the summer),
to keep the environment more consistent for better ice conditions.

# Skater Flake Rule
Summary:
* by entering **ATTENDING** or **WAIT LIST** in invite, you are announcing your intent to **play**
* if you are in **ATTENDING** list in the invite **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are committed to **pay**

Sepcifically:
* If you are in **ATTENDING** list **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are committed to **pay**
* If join **ATTENDING** list **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are committing to **pay**
* If you are on **ATTENDING** list and fail to show after committing to **pay**, this action is called a **FLAKE**
* If you **FLAKE**, you will be put on the IOU list and you will owe the per skater cost for that event
* If you need to **FLAKE** (life happens), [mark OUT](#skater-mark-out) and you *MIGHT* be able to avoid IOU with [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list)

Please see [Confirm Your RSVP Status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) and make sure you are aware of how you RSVP'd.

The time listed as the start time of event in the [InviteApp](#benchapp) is the **scrimmage start time**.

As of 2019-08-28:
* 24hrs before Tue morning skate is Mon 6:30am
* 24hrs before Thu morning skate is Wed 7:15am
* 24hrs before Fri morning skate is Thu 6:30am

**NOTE WELL: check event itself for start time:**
* again, the times listed above are based on [upcoming schedule](../news/news.md) as of 2019-08-28

**In conclusion**:
* please do **not** enter **ATTENDING** or **WAIT LIST** unless you plan on **playing**
* please do **not** be a part of **ATTENDING** list anytime with **&lt;** 24hrs before the event unless you plan on **paying**
* all 20 spots must be paid for in order for [POC](#poc) to cover rink cost
* no patron of [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082) (including [POC](#poc)) makes a profit on the pickup
* [POC](#poc) members pay the per skater fee for each event, same as everyone else
* [POC](#poc) members pay IOUs when they flake, same as everyone else

If you have any questions or feedback about the **FLAKE** rule, please contact the [POC](#poc).

# Skater Mark Out

You are encouraged to mark **OUT** as soon as you know you cannot make it:
* marking **no-RSVP &rarr; OUT**:
  * tells everyone you definitely cannot make it
  * [POC](#poc) will not bug you with a text about open spots when they know you cannot make it
* marking **IN &rarr; OUT**:
  * frees up a spot for someone else to play
  * _**might**_ save you from an IOU (see below)

Marking IN &rarr; OUT &lt; 24 hrs before the event, is a [flake](#skater-flake-rule), _**however:**_
* you _**should**_ still mark OUT when you know you cannot make it
* marking OUT is better than leaving yourself IN and not showing
* if someone from **WAIT LIST** is assigned **the spot you are freeing up on a _full_ event**, your IOU is forgiven
* flaked spots are filled by **WAIT LIST** takers **in the order skaters mark OUT** (so, mark OUT early)

**In conclusion**, the earlier you mark OUT, the better:
* if **&gt;** 24hrs before event, no IOU
* if **&lt;** 24hrs before event, a wait lister _**might**_ clear your IOU

Even if it becomes apparent only 1 hour before the event that you cannot make it:
* please mark OUT if you can (note: the mobile app makes it easier to mark OUT on the go)
* some patrons check for open spots the morning of events

# Skater Wait List
If you would like to attend a full event, you may add yourself to **WAIT LIST**.
The time at which you enter the wait list is recorded.
The wait list is sorted by this timestamp in ascending order.
When a player leaves the **ATTENDING** list, the player at the top of **WAIT LIST**
is moved to **ATTENDING** list.

**Current manual operation of WAIT LIST**:
* currently, the moving of a player from **WAIT LIST** to **ATTENDING** list is manual<br/>(a request has been sent to the [InviteApp](#benchapp) folks to make it **automatic**)
* management may not get around to moving players from **WAIT LIST** to **ATTENDING** immediately
* management will confirm that you still want to play via text
* skaters named "WAIT LIST1" and "WAIT LIST2" are used to reserve wait list spots under **ATTENDING**
* after **8pm the night before event**
   * management stops considering **WAIT LIST**
   * removes "WAIT LIST1" and "WAIT LIST2" from **ATTENDING**
   * if anyone drops out of **ATTENDING** in the middle of the night, those spots are open to anyone in the morning

**As always, follow [confirm your RSVP status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) instructions after any RSVP and see where you actually ended up.**

# Confirm Your RSVP Status

**Confirm Your RSVP Status** on the [InviteApp](#benchapp) **Event Page** using **Web Browser**:
1. go to [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082) dashboard
1. find the event **and click on the event**
1. you now have a **refreshed view** of the **Event Page** for that event
1. see your choice at the **TOP** of the **Event Page** (see big IN/OUT toggle)

A **refreshed view** is important.  By following he process above, you are forcing the web browser to show what the [InviteApp](#benchapp) backend actually has for your RSVP.

# Goalies
* goalies play for free
* if you know a goalie that would like to play, please contact [POC](#poc)
* [POC](#poc) tries very hard to have two goalies (regulars and/or subs) at every event and almost always does:
  * but only with your help&hellip; most goalies become a part of [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082) through referrals!
  * finding subs is easier with a healthy cache of goalie contact info

# Details

Invite for an event goes out a week in advance.<br/>
Event time in invite is set to "scrimmage start".<br/>
"doors open" is always a half hour before "scrimmage start".

As of 2019-08-28:
* Tue: scrimmage 6:30am - 8:00am (doors open 6:00am)
* Thu: scrimmage 7:15am - 8:30am (doors open 6:45am)
* Fri: scrimmage 6:30am - 8:00am (doors open 6:00am)

Check ([upcoming schedule](../news/news.md)) for any special timings (holidays, summer hours, etc).

Please pay and sign-in when you arrive (not after the event, please).<br/>
Please arrive in time to be ready and warmed up by "scrimmage start" (see above):
* in the mornings, people need to get to work (start early, end early).
* patrons want to maximize their ice time (at least 1.25hrs)

Vallco has legit showers upstairs.  For morning sessions, many people head straight to work after.

[POC](#poc) caps each session at 22 players (20 skaters and 2 goalies).<br/>
The result is 2 lines, 5 on 5:
* A-line (approximate skill: Sharks Ice - 5, 6, 7a levels)
* B-line (approximate skill: Sharks Ice - 7b, 8 levels)

[InviteApp](#benchapp) will not allow more than 20 skaters and 2 goalies per event.
If you show up and are not listed on the sign-in sheet, you will not be allowed to play
if we are full &#128550;. Suggest: [confirming your RSVP status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) in [InviteApp](#benchapp)
to make absolutely sure your RSVP is what you believe it to be before waking up early and
heading to the rink.

# Spare Skaters

**Summary:**
* Friday invite goes out around 9:30am the Friday before (a few hours short of 1 week in advance)
* **FridayFullTime** skaters (there are around 20 grandfathered in with this status):
   * get the Friday invite via email immediately after **Friday** invite is created
   * are allowed to mark IN and join **ATTENDING** list immediately
* **not FridayFullTime** skaters
   * can see the Friday invite in [InviteApp](#benchapp) and should get a push notification to mobile app
   * are allowed to join **WAIT LIST** list immediately in invite
        * NOTE: the _**change**_ from previous application behavior:
            * [RosterBot/SportGo](https://lite.sportgo.com) had no **WAIT LIST**
            * Spares were only able to join the Friday **WAIT LIST** on Tuesday around 9:30am
   * on Tuesday around 9:30am
        * the invite for the coming Friday is sent to everyone in email
   * after Tuesday around 9:30am and as spots become available under **ATTENDING** list on the Friday invite:
        * **WAIT LIST** folks are moved to **ATTENDING**
        * when **WAIT LIST** is empty, anyone can enter **ATTENDING** list directly
* Tuesday and Thursday skates
   * all skaters get the invite immediately and can mark IN to join **ATTENDING** list immediately
   * all skaters beyond 20 max can join the **WAIT LIST** immediately

**App Details:**
* [RosterBot/SportGo](https://lite.sportgo.com) had the concepts of **Full-time** and **Spare**
* [BenchApp](#benchapp) has similar concepts: **ROSTER** and **SPARE**
* all skaters are **SPARE** in [BenchApp](#benchapp)
* **ROSTER** is not used in [BenchApp](#benchapp) because it unintentionally treats **ROSTER** differently
    * sends the Tuesday Thursday invite to them first before **SPARE**s
    * puts them on top of **WAIT LIST**
* please read the section on [Skater RSVP Too Fast](#skater-rsvp-too-fast) for details on a bug with [BenchApp](#benchapp)

For helping out with the pickup, members of [POC](#poc) are added to **ATTENDING** list on all weekday morning events they choose to attend when the invite goes out (note: not all members of [POC](#poc) attend all weekday morning events).

Please contact [Eric](#poc) if you have questions about **FridayFullTime**.

# Skater RSVP Too Fast

Spots are limited and people race to mark **IN** and become part of **ATTENDING** list.

There is a problem with [BenchApp](#benchapp) where it is possible to RSVP too fast:
* there is a **window of time** between when the invite is created and when skaters are invited
* during this window (&lt; 1min), a member of [POC](#poc) is racing to invite skaters<br/>(it is a manual process and there is no work around currently)
* if you find an invite during this window:
   * you will only be given the choice to join **WAIT LIST**
* for Tuesday and Thursday invites
   * everyone is invited a very short time after invite is created
   * if you see the option to join **WAIT LIST** only and the event is **not full**:
      * this means you are in the window and you need hit refresh on your browser
      * try again to mark **IN** and join the **ATTENDING** list
   * if you see the option to join **WAIT LIST** only and the event **is full**:
      * go ahead and join the **WAIT LIST**
* for Friday invites
   * only [FridayFullTime](#spare-skaters) are invited a very short time after invite is created
   * if you are [**not** FridayFullTime](#spare-skaters):
       * go ahead and join the **WAIT LIST** immediately
   * if you are [FridayFullTime](#spare-skaters):
       * if you see the option to join **WAIT LIST** only and the event is **not full**
          * this means you are in the window and you need hit refresh on your browser
          * try again to mark **IN** and join the **ATTENDING** list

**As always, follow [confirm your RSVP status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) instructions after any RSVP and see where you actually ended up.**
