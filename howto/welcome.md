# Skater IOU List
IOU list keeps tracked of skaters that owe money or skaters who are owed money.
IOUs may be settled the next time you skate (reminder on sign-in sheet next to your name).
Current IOU list is under **Notes** field of every [InviteApp](#benchapp) invite
(please note that as IOUs are settled, [POC](#poc) does not necessary go back and update **Notes**
field of existing invites).  Only the last invite sent out will have the most up to date
IOU information and that information is only up to date at the time that invite was sent out.
If you would like to settle your IOU before your next skate, please arrange electronic payment
with one of the [POC](#poc).

# Invite Only
This is an "invite only" pickup in that it is a private event not open to public.
Only people invited to [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082)
are allowed to attend. People who show up unannounced are not allowed to play.

If you would like to refer a friend, great, please send their contact info to [POC](#poc).<br/>
[POC](#poc) is under no obligation to invite someone or keep inviting someone.

At the discretion of [POC](#poc),
anyone may be uninvited from [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082).

Examples of things that get a player uninvited:
* combative
* style of play lends itself to people getting hurt
* IOU(s) more than one year old

# Goalies Do Not RSVP
[POC](#poc) arranges for goalies in advance and RSVPs for goalies.<br/>
[POC](#poc) marks "regular" goalies IN when the invite goes out.<br/>
When a regular cannot make it, [POC](#poc) will:
* contact substitute goalies directly
* RSVP for the substitute goalie

# Skater RSVP
* you are not required to RSVP
* if you do not RSVP, you are assumed **OUT**
* marking **OUT** when you know you cannot make it: [is encouraged](#skater-mark-out)
* marking **IN** is encouraged: **come on, let's play!** &#128513;

# Skater Flake Rule
By marking IN, you are committing to **play**.<br/>
When marked IN at any time **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are committing to **pay**.

Sepcifically:
* If your choice is IN **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are committed to **pay**
* If you mark IN (or join WAIT LIST) at any time **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are committing to **pay**
* If you are on **ATTENDING** list and fail to show after committing to **pay**, this action is called a **FLAKE**
* If you **FLAKE**, you will be put on the IOU list and you will owe the per skater cost for that event
* If you need to **FLAKE** (life happens), [mark OUT](#skater-mark-out) and you *MIGHT* be able to avoid IOU with [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list)

Please see [Confirm Your RSVP Status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) and make sure you are aware of how you RSVP'd.

The time listed as the start time of event in the [InviteApp](#benchapp) is the **scrimmage start time**.

As of 2019-07-21:
* 24hrs before Tue morning skate is Mon 6:30am
* 24hrs before Thu morning skate is Wed 7:15am
* 24hrs before Fri morning skate is Thu 6:30am

**NOTE WELL: check event itself for start time:**
* again, the times listed above are based on [upcoming schedule](../news/news.md) as of 2019-07-21

**In conclusion**:
* please do **not** mark IN (or join WAIT LIST) unless you plan on **playing**
* please do **not** be IN anytime with **&lt;** 24hrs before the event unless you plan on **paying**
* all 20 spots must be paid for in order for [POC](#poc) to cover rink cost
* no patron of [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082) (including [POC](#poc)) makes a profit on the pickup
* [POC](#poc) members pay the per skater fee for each event, same as everyone else
* [POC](#poc) members pay IOUs when they flake, same as everyone else

If you have any questions or feedback about the **FLAKE** rule, please contact the [POC](#poc).

# Skater Mark Out

You are encouraged to mark **OUT** as soon as you know you cannot make it:
* marking **no-RSVP &rarr; OUT**:
  * tells everyone you definitely cannot make it
  * [POC](#poc) will not bug you with a text about open spots when they know you cannot make it
* marking **IN &rarr; OUT**:
  * may free up a spot for someone else to play
  * may save you from an IOU

Marking IN &rarr; OUT &lt; 24 hrs before the event, is a [flake](#skater-flake-rule), _**however:**_
* you _**should**_ still mark OUT when you know you cannot make it
* marking OUT is better than leaving yourself IN and not showing
* if someone on the wait list takes _**your**_ spot, your IOU is forgiven
* flaked spots are filled by **WAIT LIST** takers **in the order skaters mark OUT** (so, mark OUT early if you need to)

**In conclusion**, the earlier you mark OUT the better:
* if **&gt;** 24hrs before event, no IOU
* if **&lt;** 24hrs before event, a wait lister _**might**_ wipe your IOU

Even if it becomes apparent only 1 hour before the event that you cannot make it:
* please mark OUT if you able to (get the mobile app)
* some patrons check for open spots the morning of events
* [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list) is considered right up to the last minute

# Skater Wait List
If you would like to attend a full event, you may add yourself to **WAIT LIST**.
The time at which you enter the wait list is recorded.
The wait list is sorted by this timestamp in ascending order.
When a player leaves the **ATTENDING** list, the player at the top of **WAIT LIST**
is moved to **ATTENDING** list.

**WARNING**, consider this scenario:
* you go to sleep the night before event as a member of **WAIT LIST**
* enough people exit the **ATTENDING** list that _***you***_ are now on the **ATTENDING** list
* you go to sleep in thinking you are not on **ATTENDING** list
* as per [flake rule](#skater-flake-rule):<br/>_"When marked IN at any time **&lt;** 24hrs before the event, you are now committing to **pay**._<br/>**you are now committed to pay**
* suggest: take yourself **OFF** the wait list the night before if you do not intend to wake up early and [confirm your RSVP status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status)

**As always, follow [confirm your RSVP status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) instructions after any RSVP and see where you actually ended up.**<br/>

# Confirm Your RSVP Status

**Confirm Your RSVP Status** on the [InviteApp](#benchapp) **Event Page** using **Web Browser**:
1. go to [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082) dashboard
1. find the event **and click on the event**
1. you now have a **refreshed view** of the **Event Page** for that event
1. see your choice at the **TOP** of the **Event Page** (see big IN/OUT toggle)

A **refreshed view** is important.  By following he process above, you are forcing the web browser to show what the [InviteApp](#benchapp) backend actually has for your RSVP.

# Goalies
* goalies play for free
* if you know a goalie that would like to play, please contact [POC](#poc)
* [POC](#poc) tries very hard to have two goalies (regulars and/or subs) at every event and almost always does:
  * but only with your help&hellip; most goalies become a part of [Vallco Morning Pickup](https://www.benchapp.com/switch/season/43082) through referrals!
  * finding subs is easier with a healthy cache of goalie contact info

# Details

Invite for an event goes out a week in advance.<br/>
Event time in invite is set to "scrimmage start".<br/>
"doors open" is always a half hour before "scrimmage start".

As of 2019-07-21:
* Tue: scrimmage 6:30am - 8:00am (doors open 6:00am)
* Thu: scrimmage 7:15am - 8:30am (doors open 6:45am)
* Fri: scrimmage 6:30am - 8:00am (doors open 6:00am)

Check ([upcoming schedule](../news/news.md)) for any special timings (holidays, summer hours, etc).

Please pay and sign-in when you arrive (not after the event, please).<br/>
Please arrive in time to be ready and warmed up by "scrimmage start" (see above):
* in the mornings, people need to get to work (start early, end early).
* patrons want to maximize their ice time (at least 1.25hrs)

Vallco has legit showers upstairs.  For morning sessions, many people head straight to work after.

[POC](#poc) caps each session at 22 players (20 skaters and 2 goalies).<br/>
The result is 2 lines, 5 on 5:
* A-line (approximate skill: Sharks Ice - 5, 6, 7a levels)
* B-line (approximate skill: Sharks Ice - 7b, 8 levels)

[InviteApp](#benchapp) will not allow more than 20 skaters and 2 goalies per event.
If you show up and are not listed on the sign-in sheet, you will not be allowed to play
if we are full &#128550;. Suggest: [confirming your RSVP status](#confirm-your-rsvp-status) in [InviteApp](#benchapp)
to make absolutely sure your RSVP is what you believe it to be before waking up early and
heading to the rink.

# Spare Skaters

There is contention for spots, and even though [POC](#poc) tries hard to make it so everyone
gets an equal chance to play, there are those grandfathered in with **FridayFullTime** status.

Those with **FridayFullTime** status are placed under **ATTENDING**
when the Friday invite goes out (securing them a Friday spot).  It is then their
responsibility to mark **OUT** if they cannot make it
(subject to [flake rule](#skater-flake-rule)).

There is no **FridayFullTime** status in the [InviteApp](#benchapp).
Everyone is classified as **SPARE** in the [InviteApp](#benchapp)
and everything else about the invite system is the same among skaters.

For helping out with the pickup, members of [POC](#poc) are added to **ATTENDING** on all weekday morning events they choose to attend when the invite goes out (note: not all members of [POC](#poc) attend all weekday morning events).

Please contact [Eric](#poc) if you have questions about this.
