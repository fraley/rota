# Skater IOU List
IOU list keeps tracked of skaters that owe money or skaters who are owed money.
IOUs may be settled the next time you skate (reminder on sign-in sheet next to your name).
Current IOU list is sent out in **Event Description** field of every sportgo event invite.
If you would like your name off the IOU list before your next skate,
please arrange electronic payment with one of the [POC](#poc).

# Invite Only
This is an "invite only" pickup in that it is a private event not open to public.
Only people invited via sportgo team
[Vallco Pickup](https://lite.sportgo.com/teams/MDMzYzFkZTJkODU5YmIxM2Q0NmNhZWZhNWM4NzMwYTU)
are allowed to attend.
[POC](#poc) are under no obligation to invite someone or keep inviting someone.  People who
show up unannounced are not allowed to play.  If you have a friend that would like
to play, great, please send their contact info to [POC](#poc).  At the discretion of [POC](#poc),
anyone's membership of team "Vallco Pickup" may be suspended.

Examples of things that get a player suspended:
* IOU(s) more than one year old
* style of play lends itself to people getting hurt

# Goalies Do Not RSVP
[POC](#poc) arranges for goalies in advance and RSVPs for goalies.
We have regular goalies that are marked IN on invite when it goes out.
When a substitute is needed, Ken Gudan (Tues and Fri) or
Daniel Garaycochea (Sat) will contact goalies directly.
Ken and Daniel handle the RSVPs for goalies in sportgo.

# Skater Flake Rule
If you do not mark IN or OUT, you are assumed OUT and will not be allowed to play.

Please do not mark IN unless you are planning to show.

**24hrs before the event** is 24hrs before event time in sportgo (scrimmage start):
* 24hrs before Tuesday Pickup is Monday 6:30am (6:30am in summer)
* 24hrs before Friday Pickup is Thursday 7:00am (6:30am in summer)
* 24hrs before Saturday Pickup is Friday 10:15pm

By marking IN, you are committing to play:
* If your choice is IN &lt; 24hrs before the event, you are committed to play
* If you mark IN at any time &lt; 24hrs before the event, you are committed to play
* If you fail to show after committing to play, this action is a **FLAKE**
* If you **FLAKE**, you will be put on the IOU list and you will owe the per skater cost for that event
* If you need to **FLAKE** (life happens), you *MIGHT* be able to avoid IOU with [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list)

Please see [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice) and make sure your choice is recorded.

If you have any questions or feedback about the **FLAKE** rule, please contact the [POC](#poc).

# Skater Mark Out
If you do not mark IN or OUT (no-RSVP), you are assumed OUT and will not be allowed to play.

There is contention for spots.  The number of skaters is capped at 20.

If you know you cannot make it, marking OUT is a sign of good faith:
* marking no-RSVP &rarr; OUT tells everyone you definitely cannot make it (helps with planning)
* marking IN &rarr; OUT frees up a spot for someone else to play

Marking IN &rarr; OUT &lt; 24 hrs before the event is a [flake](skater-flake-rule).
When you cannot make it, marking OUT is better than leaving yourself IN (frowned upon by [POC](#poc)).
Also, if [POC](#poc) is able to find a sub for you, you *MIGHT* be able to avoid IOU with [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list).
Note well: spots filled from wait list are taken **in the order FLAKERs mark OUT**.

**Bottom line**: if you cannot make it, it is better for everyone (including you) if you mark OUT as soon as possible.

Even if it becomes apparent only 1 hour before the event that you cannot make it,
please mark OUT if you can (some people check for open spots right before events
and [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list) is considered right up to the last minute
and your IOU will be waived if someone takes your spot).

# Skater Wait List
If you are a skater that wants to play and the event is full, please text a [POC](#poc):
* Paul Fraley for Tue/Fri morn skates
* Daniel Garaycochea for Sat nights skates

Your position on the wait list is the order in which your text was received.<br/>
Your position is secured by [POC](#poc) using fake skaters **WAIT LIST1**, **WAIT LIST2**, ...

If you want IN:
* for all invites, first try to get IN, if successful, then [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice)

If you want IN and event is full:
if Tuesday, Saturday or [early summer hours](#early-summer), contact [POC](#poc) immediately
* if Friday, Full-timers can contact [POC](#poc) immediately
* if Friday, Spares may contact [POC](#poc) after Friday invite is open to Spares (some time Tuesday morning)

If you are a skater that needs to [flake](skater-flake-rule):
* please mark OUT early as possible
* if many skaters [flake](skater-flake-rule), the order in which these skaters marked OUT matters:
   * first one to mark OUT gets IOU forgiven by the next wait lister
   * if there are no wait listers at the time you mark OUT, you will likely have IOU

# Skater Marking IN or OUT
Sportgo has multiple ways to mark IN or OUT: web browser (desktop/laptop), email, mobile app, etc.<br/>
The mobile app is the same web interface available to desktop/laptop.

We recommend people use web browser on desktop/laptop method to:
* mark IN or OUT
* [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice)

Email and mobile app may let you mark IN or OUT when you cannot get to a desktop/laptop...<br/>
**HOWEVER**, please web browser on desktop/laptop and steps 1, 2, 3 below to [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice).

Why [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice) is important:<br/>
* when you mark IN or OUT, sportgo has been reported to not always give feedback when it fails to record your choice (whether you are using web browser, email, mobile app, etc)
* so... sometimes, you may think you marked IN or OUT, but you actually did not

Therefore, it is **VERY** important for you to always double check by doing the following:

<a id="confirm-your-choice"/>**Confirm Your Choice** on the sportgo **Event Page** using **Web Browser**:
1. **start fresh**: go to https://app.sportgo.com/home
1. find the event **and click on the event**
1. you are now on the **Event Page** for that event
   * **Your Choice** is shown at the TOP of the **Event Page** (see the big IN/OUT toggle at **TOP** of the **Event Page**)

Sportgo has changed the design of the **Event Page** in the past and may change it in the future.
In the current version of **Event Page**, you will **also** be listed along with all of the other attendees.
To determine if you are IN or OUT, however, please look at the IN or OUT choice recorded at the **TOP** of
the **Event Page** and _**only after**_ you **start fresh**.

**Start fresh** is important.  You force the web browser to refresh its view with what sportgo actually recorded.

If you do not respond to an event (no-RSVP), you are assumed OUT for that event.

Marking IN < 24hrs before the event is ok, but then you are committed to that event.<br/>

Going from IN &rarr; OUT < 24hrs before the event is ok, but is a [flake](skater-flake-rule) (see [Skater Flake Rule](skater-flake-rule) for details).

**Please do not mark IN unless you plan on coming.**

# GOALIES
Goalies play for free.<br/>
If you know a goalie that would like to play, point them to appropriate [POC](#poc).<br/>
We try very hard to have two regular goalies and almost always do.<br/>
We occasionally need a subs.  Having a cache of goalie contact info helps.

# Details
Invite for an event goes out a week in advance.
Event time in invite is set to "scrimmage start".<br/>
"doors open" is always a half hour before "scrimmage start"

REGULAR Tue: scrimmage 6:30am - 8:00am (doors open 6:00am).<br/>
REGULAR Fri: scrimmage 7:00am - 8:30am (doors open 6:30am).<br/>
SUMMER: scrimmage 6:30am - 7:45am (doors open 6:00am).<br/>
<a id="early-summer"/>EARLY SUMMER: scrimmage 5:15am - 6:30am (doors open 4:45am).<br/>

Saturdays:
scrimmage 10:15pm - 11:30pm, (doors open 9:45pm)

Please pay and sign-in when you arrive (not after the event, please).<br/>
Please arrive in time to be ready and warmed up by "scrimmage start" (see above).

We need to start promptly at "scrimmage start".  Why it is important to be on time:
* in the mornings, people need to get to work (start early, end early)
* at night, Zamboni driver wants to go home (going past "scrimmage end" may or may not happen)

Bottom line: we want to maximize our ice time (at least 1.25hrs).  Please be on time.

Vallco has legit showers upstairs.  For morning sessions, many people head straight to work after.

We cap each session at 22 players (20 skaters and 2 goalies).<br/>
This makes it nice (2 lines, 5 on 5):
* A-line (Sharks Ice - 5, 6, 7a levels)
* B-line (Sharks Ice - 7b, 8 levels)

Sportgo will not allow more than 20 skaters and 2 goalies per event.

If, for example, you failed to [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice) on the sportgo EVENT PAGE
(see [Confirm Your Choice](#confirm-your-choice) above) after you *thought* you marked IN and you show
up at "doors open" time (see "doors open" above) to find yourself not on the sign-in sheet,
you will not be allowed to play if we are full.

# Skater Spare vs. Full-time

Your status starts out as **Spare**.  To find out your status:
* go to the [Vallco Pickup team page](https://lite.sportgo.com/teams/MDMzYzFkZTJkODU5YmIxM2Q0NmNhZWZhNWM4NzMwYTU)
* click on any of the events
* you will see either **Spare** or **Full-time** under your name at the top of **Event Page**

For Tuesday mornings, Saturday nights and [early summer hours](#early-summer):
* everyone gets to respond immediately (no difference between Spare and Full-time)
* if after [attempting to mark IN](#skater-marking-in-or-out), you [confirm](#confirm-your-choice) and find that you are OUT, try the [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list)

For Friday mornings:
* only Full-timers get to respond IN immediately after Friday invite goes out
* Spares can respond IN to Friday invite when it is opened to Spares<br/>(sometime early morning after the next Tuesday invite is sent out)
* if after [attempting to mark IN](#skater-marking-in-or-out), you [confirm](#confirm-your-choice) and find that you are OUT, try the [Skater Wait List](#skater-wait-list)

[Eric](#poc) decides who gets promoted to **Full-time**.  Please contact [Eric](#poc) if you have questions about this.
