# Prepaid Saturday Nights

Starting in 2019:
* 20 skaters buy a block of 20 scrimmages for $18/game ($360)
* 10:15pm - 11:30pm, 2 lines (A and B) of 5-on-5, 2min buzzer (same as current Saturday night)

# Invite and RSVP

Invite will be sent out the Sunday before (as is done currently).<br/>
Prepaid skaters will be marked IN automatically.<br/>
Mark yourself OUT when you cannot make it, freeing up a spot for sub.

# Subs and Waitlist

Non-prepay skaters still have a chance to play:
* empty slots will be allocated first come, first serve
* subs pay $20

Mgmt will maintain a waitlist when the invite is full.<br/>
If sub takes _**your**_ prepaid spot, you get your $18 back.<br/>
Spots allocated to subs in the order in which owner marked OUT.

Bottom line: the earlier you mark OUT, the more likely you are to get your $18 back.

If you are marked IN but do not show, this action is known as a **flake**.<br/>
If you are prepay and you flake, you lose $18.<br/>
If you are non-prepay and you flake, you have $20 IOU (current IOU system).


# Deadlines

Commitment and $20 deposit: **2018-11-15** (money goes to Sat night beverage fund).<br/>
Payment of $340 in cash: **2018-12-01** (money goes to rink).

If we are unable to get commitments or payments by the deadlines:
* you get your deposit and payment back
* we decide on the fate of Saturday night
