If you are getting this link you are invited to participate in **Prepaid Saturday Nights**.

# Prepaid Saturday Nights

Starting in 2019:
* 20 skaters buy a block of 20 scrimmages for $18/game ($360)
* 10:15pm - 11:30pm, 2 lines of 5-on-5, 2min buzzer (same as current Saturday night)

# Invite

Invite will be sent out the Sunday before (as is done currently).<br/>
Prepaid skaters will be marked IN automatically.<br/>
When you know you cannot make it, mark yourself OUT, freeing up a spot for sub.

# Subs and Waitlist

Non-prepay people still have a chance to play:
* empty slots will be allocated first come, first serve
* subs pay $20

Paul will maintain a waitlist when the invite is full.<br/>
If sub takes _**your**_ prepaid spot, you get your $18 back.<br/>
Spots allocated to subs in the order in which owner marked OUT.

Bottom line: the earlier you mark OUT, the more likely you are to get your $18 back.

If you are marked IN but do not show, this action is known as a **flake**.<br/>
If you are prepay and you flake, you lose $18.<br/>
If you are non-prepay and you flake, you have $20 IOU (current IOU system).


# Deadlines

Commitment and $20 deposit: **2018-11-15** (money goes to Sat night beverage fund).<br/>
Payment of $340 in cash: **2018-12-01** (money goes to rink).

If we are unable to get commitments or payments by the deadlines:
* you get your deposit and payment back
* someone else manages Saturday night -or- it dies

# What Nights?

First 20 viable Saturdays of 2019.<br/>
Non-viable Saturdays are those that are land on a holiday.<br/>

# Reasoning

**Advantages to Skater:**
* guaranteed spot
* if you are already a regular, you will save $40 over 20 games
* establishing lines (playing with your friends)
   * is encouraged
   * will be accommodated to the best of our ability (we cannot have it lopsided)
   * we will still do line-A and line-B

**Advantages to Mgmt**:<br/>
* we pay the bills and can enjoy ourselves
* mgmt gets a break (it takes a tremendous amount of energy to get 20 skaters to show every week)

# Money Details

Rink charges $340/Saturday.<br/>
20 skaters paying $360 for 20 games allows $20/game for beverages.<br/>
